## Project description
This project aims to use the restaurant tips dataset to practice creating composition plots and visualizations. We will examine the relationship between different variables and the tips given.
## Data description
The dataset consists of information from 244 restaurant bills, collected in the US in 1987.

It includes details about the tips given to restaurant staff, such as the total bill, tip amount, gender of the person paying, smoking status, day of the week, time of day, and party size.

The data can be loaded from the following link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RusAbk/sca_datasets/main/tips.csv

## The main goals
The goal is to determine the tipping pattern based on different factors, including smoking status, gender, days of the week, and meal time.  The analysis should answer the following questions:

1. Do people who smoke give more tips?

2. Do males give more tips?

3. Do weekends bring more tips?

4. Do dinners bring more tips?
## Key results

* Regardless the smoking status, most customers give average 3 USD tips. However, it seems that smokers give more tips in average.
* While both genders commonly tip between 2 and 3 USD, males are occasionally more likely to give higher tips than females.
* It seems that customers tend to tip higher on weekends, while on weekdays customers show more variation in tipping amount.
* Dinner generates higher and more varied tip amounts compared to lunch.
